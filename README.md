# FIFO App for Crypto

This app calculates your cryptocurrency profits and losses. It is designed for Finnish audience.

## Crypto Taxes in Finland

Income received from trading cryptocurrencies is taxable and you are required to file any income and expenses. Sometimes this might get tricky as the cost of an asset is determined by using the FIFO principle.

### What's FIFO?

FIFO – *First In, First Out* – is an asset management principle in which assets bought first are sold first.

### So What's Tricky About It?

Well, imagine calculating costs of cryptocurrencies on hundreds or even thousands of trades. Trying to keep track of which piece of Bitcoin you bought first is difficult and tedious.

### Deemed Acquisition Cost

There's also this thing called the *deemed acquisition cost* which you can use alternatively. The deemed acquisition cost of your asset is 20% of the selling price or 40% if you've owned the asset for over 10 years. Using the deemed acquisition cost might make sense if the real cost of an asset is less than the deemed one (greater cost means less taxes).
