## Crypto Taxes in Finland

Income received from trading cryptocurrencies is taxable and you are required to file any income and expenses. Sometimes this might get tricky as the cost of an asset is determined by using the FIFO principle.

### What's FIFO?

FIFO – First In, First Out – is an asset management principle in which assets bought first are sold first. So for example lets say you bought an apple for 1€ yesterday and two apples for 2€ each today. Then you decide to sell two apples tomorrow for 1.5€ each. Based on the FIFO principle you didn't gain any profit or loss as one of the two apples cost 1€ and the other one 2€.
