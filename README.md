# FIFO App for Crypto (*Work in Progress...*)

This app calculates cryptocurrency profits and losses. It's designed for Finnish audience.

## Crypto Tax in Finland

Income received from trading cryptocurrencies is taxable and one is required to file any income and expenses. Sometimes this might get tricky as the cost of an asset is determined by using the FIFO principle.

### What's FIFO?

FIFO – *First In, First Out* – is an asset management principle in which assets bought first are sold first.

### So What's Tricky About It?

Well, imagine calculating costs of cryptocurrencies on hundreds or even thousands of trades. Trying to keep track of which piece of Bitcoin you bought first is difficult and tedious.

### Deemed Acquisition Cost

You could use the *deemed acquisition cost* alternatively. The deemed acquisition cost of your asset is 20% of the selling price or 40% if you've owned the asset for over 10 years. Using the deemed acquisition cost might make sense if the real cost of an asset is less than the deemed one (as greater cost means less taxes).

## About the App / Goals for the App

* There's many crypto tax applications online which rely on automatically fetching and processing transaction data. However, often there's a lot of mistakes in the processed data and users have to manually go through everything to check for whatever happens to be wrong. This app doesn't automatically fetch and process data. Rather this app's goal is to be **an easy and simple tool for manually keeping record of crypto trades as they come about**.
